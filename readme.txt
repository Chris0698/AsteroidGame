University assignment which was to develop a provided very basic game and a simple game in C++. The game is a simple asteroid shooter game. The assignment did not focus on the gameplay aspect so elements such as a HUD and a win condition so these are not developed, although there are start of implementation that could be developed further. 

An aspect of the assignment was "an advance component" which could have been a component architecture system, a memory management system or a sprite component. I went with the component architecture hence objects such as the player ship and asteroid have unique components. The components make use of inhertiance and polymorphism and are flexible so a new component can be added. 

This project replied on vector maths for rocks and spaceship direction and angle of travel. Debugging was also heavily required to check for null pointers and other unexpected behavior that occured throughout development. 

Should you wish to run the .exe, the executable is located in the ShellEngine/Debug directories.
